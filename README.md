# Run (Shell Command) Before Build

This plugin allows the user to define a shell command to run before build (dev) or export (release).

## Configure

Go to the [constants.gd](/addons/runbeforebuild/constants.gd) file and change the constants there.  
After that you need either to disable and re-enable the plugin, or restart the Godot Editor
