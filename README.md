This plugin is 100% type hinted, and it allows the user to define a shell command to run before build (dev) or export (release).  
It was tested in Godot 4.1 and 4.2.  
Can be used, for example, to compile gdextentions.

## Configure

Go to the [constants.gd](/addons/runbeforebuild/constants.gd) file and change the constants there.  
After that you need either to disable and re-enable the plugin, or restart the Godot Editor, and you're done!
